Parser directive
#escape=\
or
#escape=`
the escape directive sets the character used to escape characters in a Dockerfile, if not sepecified, the default escape character is \.
setting the escape character to ` is especially useful on Windows. where \ is the direcoty path separtor.

CMD
there can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile, if you list more than one CMD, then ony the last CMD will take effect.
Note: Donâ€™t confuse RUN with CMD. RUN actually runs a command and commits the result; CMD does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended command for the image.
