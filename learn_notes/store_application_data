Type of mount:
-Volumes: are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker(/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on linux)
          Volumes are the best way to persist data in Docker.
-Bind mounts:may be stored anywhere on the host system. 
-tmpfs: mounts are stored in the host system's memory only, and are never written to the host system's filesystem.


More details:
1. A given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simutaneously.
2. When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container.
3. Good use cases for volumes:1) sharing data among multiple running containers;2)when you want to store your container's data
                                 on a remote host or a cloud provider,rather than locally; 3)when you need to back up, restore
                                 or migrate data from one Docker host to another.
4.Good use cases for bind mounts:1)sharing configuration files from the host machine to containers; 2)sharing source code or 
                                    build artifacts between a development environment on the Docker host and a container;
